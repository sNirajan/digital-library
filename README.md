# Digital Library Management System

A secure, full-stack Java application built using **Spring Boot** and **MySQL** for managing a digital library’s core operations — including user authentication, role-based access control, book catalog management, and borrowing functionality.

This project demonstrates my ability to design and maintain robust Java backend systems with a focus on reliability, modularity, and security.

## Features

-  **Role-Based Access Control**: Admins and general users have separate capabilities.
-  **Book Catalog Management**: Add, update, remove, and browse books.
-  **Borrowing System**: Users can check out and return books with transaction tracking.
-  **Validation & Error Handling**: Backend input validation and structured exception handling for reliability.
-  **Modular Backend Design**: Follows clean object-oriented principles using service and controller layers.
